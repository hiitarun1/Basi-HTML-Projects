# 🌐 Basic HTML Projects

Welcome to the **Basic HTML Projects** repository! This collection includes some of the simple, beginner-friendly projects I built using just **HTML** (and some may include CSS). These mini-projects helped me in learning the fundamentals of web development.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — markup language for creating web pages  
- *(Optional)* **CSS** — for basic styling (in some files)
